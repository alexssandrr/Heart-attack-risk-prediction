### In this project I made an app which will help us predict the risk of a Heart Attack a person have.
### I used various algorithms to predict the result and see which one suits best and then we will use Auto ML Library EVAL ML to predict the results.

### The things which were made in the program:
- Data Analysis 
- Feature Engineering 
- Satandardization
- Model Building
- Predictions

### I used the following models for predictions :
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K Nearest Neighbour
- SVM
